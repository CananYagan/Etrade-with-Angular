Canan Says:
I made a project development on the frontand side with Angular and on the backend side with C#. I can call the API related to products and category from my backend 'Etrade' project in my angular project and select the products on the basis of category and add them to the cart. I can select more than one product in the cart and delete these products. I will also add a login page to my project. I plan to add a page where I will show product details and a picture of the products.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
